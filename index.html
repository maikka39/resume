                <p class="comments">During my internship at ASML's Cyber Defense Center (CDC), I worked as a DevSecOps
                    Engineer for the Threat Intelligence team. I gained hands-on experience in Cybersecurity
                    Engineering, Data Science, and Threat Hunting. Collaborating with another intern and experienced
                    professionals, we conceptualized and implemented a new use-case for the team, managing the entire
                    development and deployment process. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that deepened my
                    technical expertise in cybersecurity.</p>

                <p class="comments">I worked on various projects for Ace & Tate and Cloudwise. At Ace & Tate, my team
                    developed an API using Vision AI to extract glasses prescriptions from images and detect specific
                    glasses models. We also implemented an authentication framework in Scala for microservices. At
                    Cloudwise, I contributed to extending existing applications and introducing new login methods for
                    Windows devices using Java, Azure, Angular, Typescript, and Google Cloud Platform.</p>
